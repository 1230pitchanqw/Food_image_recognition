1. Use [googliser](https://github.com/teracow/googliser) to download images from google, and create a dataset for training and testing.
2. Use VGG-19 pretrained CNN to extract the features of the images (here use the con5_3 layer, and the output feature shape is (512,14,14)).
3. Build the attention model and adjust the parameters.
4. Done.
